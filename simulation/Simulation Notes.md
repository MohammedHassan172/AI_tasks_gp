Adjustments 1.1: \ 
- Fixed a small calculation error with the electrical speed calculations
- Retunned the PI controllers for better preformance
- New maximum overshoot under no load conditions is 1.6 rad/sec
- New maximum undershoot under full load conditions is around 5 rad/sec
- New settling time is 0.3 sec. Instead of the old 0.2 secs

Adjustments 1.2: \
- PI controllers have been further retuned 
- maximum overshoot has been further reduced to 0.4 rad/s
- maximum undershoot under full load conditions is now around 1.5 rad/sec
- settling time is still around 0.3s
